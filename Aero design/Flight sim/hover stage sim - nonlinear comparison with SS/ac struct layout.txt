top layer: ac_struct

ac_struct contains constants and lookup tables corresponding to the engineering design of the aircraft in question
using a structure like this as standard going forward makes inputting engineering designs of aircraft into a very modular process

first layer:
Sa - top view planform surface area of main wings (does not include imponage or fuselage, but does include the imaginary surface area of the wings inside the fuselage
Sa_top - top view planform area of entire aircraft
Sa_front - front view planform area of entire aircraft
c - mean chord of the main wing
oe - Oswald efficiency factor of the wing design
AR - main wing aspect ratio

m - total mass of the vehicle, including dry, wet, and payload
m_dry - dry mass of the vehicle with no payload
m_f - weight of only the fuel, if any
m_pay1 - weight of payload 1, if any
m_pay2 - weight of payload 2, if any

Cl - A lookup table consisting of relevant lift coefficiant values
Cd - A lookup table consisting of relevant drag coefficiant values
Cm - A lookup table consisting of relevant moment coefficiant values

dClda - A lookup table consisting of various values for the derivative of lift coefficient WRT angle of attack. the first dimension (row index) is the variation with angle of attack, 
	the 2nd dimension (column index) is the variation with velocity
dCdda - A lookup table consisting of various values for the derivative of drag coefficient WRT angle of attack. the first dimension (row index) is the variation with angle of attack, 
	the 2nd dimension (column index) is the variation with velocity
dCmda - A lookup table consisting of various values for the derivative of moment coefficient WRT angle of attack. the first dimension (row index) is the variation with angle of attack, 
	the 2nd dimension (column index) is the variation with velocity

Cl0 - A lookup table consisting of various values for the Cl0 of a Y=mx+b line given dClda.the first dimension (row index) is the variation with angle of attack, 
	the 2nd dimension (column index) is the variation with velocity
Cd0 - A lookup table consisting of various values for the Cd0 of a Y=mx+b line given dCdda.the first dimension (row index) is the variation with angle of attack, 
	the 2nd dimension (column index) is the variation with velocity
Cm0 - A lookup table consisting of various values for the Cm0 of a Y=mx+b line given dCmda.the first dimension (row index) is the variation with angle of attack, 
	the 2nd dimension (column index) is the variation with velocity

alpha - a vector of angle of attack values that represent the corresponding values of the lookups tables
vel - a vector of speed values that represent the corresponding values of the lookup tables
